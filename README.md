# Twitter - Fake News classification model
Machine learning model (based on Natural Language Processing) for classification of tweets into two categories: true information or fake news.

**End Goal**
We will be building a solution based on NLP ( Natural Language Processing).
Our task will be to create a model that can classify text into one of two groups:
- true information (label 1),
- fake information (fake news, label 2).

**CONTENT**
- notebooks with data preprocessing, transforming data into vectors, model evaluation.
- Dataset

**What is to be done?**
- cleaning and normalization of the text
- vector representation of the text
- construction of a classification model

**Dataset**
- title - the title of the article,
- text - the content of the article,
- subject - thesubject of the article,
- date -date of publication,
- is_fake - information determining whether the articleis fake news.

**What tools will we use?**
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Gensim (Word2Vec)
- NLTK
- SpaCy
- ydata_profiling
